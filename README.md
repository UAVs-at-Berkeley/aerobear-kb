# KB

### Welcome to AeroBear Software Team Knowledge Base!

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a collective **knowledge base** and **true source** of information for the software team.

This will be your goto repo for reviews of the design decision. KB will include assumptions, requirements, and alternatvies that we've considered during the course of development cycles. KB will come in handy for technical paper write ups.

In addition to the technical notes, KB will serve as a documentation repository. It will provide how-tos, team operation protocols, and etc.

Having this repository, onboarding a new member should be as easy as directing them towards this repository. KB should be able to provide a summary of: the goals of our team, the technical knowledge necessary to start contributing, and the progress we have made so far and what things are left to be done.
